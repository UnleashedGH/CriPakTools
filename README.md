CriPakTools
===========

Tool to extract/update contents of CRIWARE's CPK archive format.

-----------

This is based off of code uploaded by Falo's code released on the Xentax forums (http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10646) which was further modified by Nanashi3 (http://forums.fuwanovel.org/index.php?/topic/1785-request-for-psp-hackers/page-4).
which is then further modifed with code from YACE (yet another CPK extractor) by eternity (http://animegamemods.net/thread/701/tools-eternity) to support CPK files for "Dragon Ball: Xenoverse 2"

Be warned, I don't do much error checking so it'll probably crash if used in any way wrong :)  It shouldn't break your computer... but I take no responsibility if somehow it explodes :)

TODO :
* Add more error checking
* Clean up code
